# Green Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
### Background
My friend, Steve, wants a green stock analyzed for his parents to see if investing is worth it. The Visual Basic Application in Excel was used to find the stock's daily volume and annual return. Eleven other green stocks were then analyzed to see how the original one compared to them. Finally, I was able to use this analysis to inform Steve the best investment option for his parent. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn how to analyze multiple stocks using VBA efficiently. After running the initial analysis of the twelve different stocks, it became evident that the code could be run faster if refactored. This project analyzes the efiiciency of my refactored code. 
## Results
## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The main advantage of refactoring code is to make it quicker and more efficient. Disadvantages include potentially messing up the original code that works and even making it unusable. While refactoring can be very helpful, it is important to be careful and always save original code.
### Refactoring Code in VBA Script
Refactoring code in VBA script is advantageous since one can use as much as the original code as needed. It is also possible to place the new code next to the original code using different modules, which is useful. The main disadvantage with VBA script is the syntax sensitivity. If one does not understand the syntax, it will be difficult to rewrite the code more efficiently.
