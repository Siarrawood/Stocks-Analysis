# Green Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
### Background
My friend, Steve, wants a green stock analyzed for his parents to see if investing is worth it. The Visual Basic Application in Excel was used to find the stock's daily volume and annual return. Eleven other green stocks were then analyzed to see how the original one compared to them. Finally, I was able to use this analysis to inform Steve the best investment option for his parent. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn how to analyze multiple stocks using VBA efficiently. After running the initial analysis of the twelve different stocks, it became evident that the code could be run faster if refactored. This project analyzes the efiiciency of my refactored code.
